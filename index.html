         With a bachelor's degree in hand, from Temple University, I embarked on a journey of creativity and expression through filmmaking. Over the years I have amassed experience as a <em>Director, Cinematographer, Producer, Editor, Gaffer, Grip, AD, Production Manager, and PA.</em> Extensive and varied, I know, but I don't shy away from learning something new.  My work has encompassed Music Videos, Documentaries, Feature Films, Instructional Videos, Short Films, Spec Commercials, and TV pilots.  Over time I got into photography as a hobby to keep "my eye busy" and discover new ways of seeing.

         As we are now fully engrossed in this age of information, I find myself returning to a seed planted in me long ago before the internet, the days of the Commodore 64... Programming or as it is now termed... Coding. A familiar place from whence I came.. sitting at home in front of a computer screen trying to figure some "ish" out.
         <br><br>
         With old tools and new tools (or old tools rediscovered), I present to the world... <strong>undrstatd</strong>... a vehicle for creation, collaboration, production, and self-expression. <br><br>
